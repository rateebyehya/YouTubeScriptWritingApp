# YOUTUBE VIDEO SCRIPT WRITING APP

🚀 🚀 GENERATE YOUR YOUTUBE VIDEO SCRIPT IN SECONDS WITH LANGCHAIN 🚀 🚀 

🌐 My eighth project, with my mentor SHARATH RAJU, ventures into the realm of SCRIPT CREATION of VIDEOS of ANY KIND. 

⭐ A YOUTUBE SCRIPT WRITING TOOL, powered by LangChain, Streamlit, OpenAI, and DuckDuckGoSearchRun, transforms the way VIDEOS ARE SCRIPTED. 

💡Leveraging LANGCHAIN's capabilities, the application utilizes advanced algorithms to interpret user inputs, generate coherent narratives, and infuse creativity into the script, WHILE MAINTAINING relevance to the CHOSEN TOPIC. 

✨ PROJECT OVERVIEW: 

The user is first PROMPTED to enter the following information: 

1) OPENAI API KEY 
2) VIDEO TOPIC 
3) EXPECTED VIDEO LENGTH (in minutes) 
4) CREATIVITY (how creative they want the script to be) 

THE OUTPUT of the APPLICATION includes: 

1) VIDEO TITLE: Attention-grabbing title to entice viewers 
2) VIDEO SCRIPT: Rich and coherent script content, integrating user specifications.
3) SEARCH RESULTS: An option to explore relevant search results via DuckDuckGo.

❗  WHAT'S FASCINATING about this project is that LANGCHAIN has integrations like DuckDuckGoSearchRun that allow you to SEARCH THE INTERNET for up to date information that the LLM has NOT been trained on!!! We know that ChatGPT is trained on data prior to 2021. With DuckDuckGo, we are able to SCRAPE up to date data to improve our model's OUTPUT!!
